# From Prototypes to Production: Deploying ML Models

### 1- Model Deployment and Inference Server
- Deploying an ML model involves implementing the trained model on a server, often referred to as an inference server.
- This server handles requests to the ML model for making predictions.
- For example, if the ML model is part of a mobile application, the app will make an API call to the inference server whenever a user requests a prediction.
- The inference server then responds with the model's predicted output, known as the inference.
  
### 2- Team Involvement
- Deploying an ML model requires collaboration between ML engineers and software engineers.
- The team must ensure:
  - Reliable and efficient predictions.
  - Scalability to handle varying loads.
  - Collection of logging data for system monitoring and debugging.

### 3- System Monitoring
- Monitoring the deployed model is critical to:
  - Identify performance issues.
  - Detect data drift or concept drift, which can reduce the model's accuracy over time.
- Often, the ML model is built by one team, while deployment and monitoring are managed by another team.

### 4- MLOps (Machine Learning Operations)
- MLOps is a specialized field focused on systematically building, deploying, and maintaining ML systems.
- The primary goal of an MLOps team is to ensure that the model is:
  - Reliable and scalable.
  - Optimized for minimal costs while serving a large number of users.
  - Well-monitored with proper logs for continuous improvements.

### 5- Model Updates
- Regular updates are essential to maintain the model's reliability and optimize its performance for high-demand scenarios.
- This ensures that the system serves many users simultaneously with minimal cost and maximum efficiency.
