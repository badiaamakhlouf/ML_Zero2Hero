##### Model Final evaluation 
- This steps comes after building your model taking into consideration the model tunning and optimization
- What to do next ?  How to decide which decision to take while building a ml model
Here is some advices :
 - In case you implemented a linear regression model to predcit stock prices, after evaluation using one of the famous metrics such as MSE, MAE etc. you find that you still have some large errors in prediction
 - Here are some solutions :
    - Check Overfitting 
    - Increase training data size
    - Reduce the number of features
    - Try new sets of features such as polynomial $x^2, x^3, x_1x_2$
